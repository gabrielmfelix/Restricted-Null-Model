The functions provided in this repository are the same used in Felix, G. M., Pinheiro, R. B. P., Poulin, R., Krasnov, B. R., & de Mello, M. A. R. (2017). The compound topology of a continent-wide interaction network explained by an integrative hypothesis of specialization. bioRxiv, 236687.
These functions can be used to simulate random matrices which conserve both the modular structure and marginal totals of a given real interaction matrix. The restricted null model is particularly useful when testing the compound topology hypothesis
