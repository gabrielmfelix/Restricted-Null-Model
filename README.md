## Functionality and origin

R code provided in this repository can be used to simulate null interaction matrices that conserve both the modular structure and the marginal totals of a given  interaction matrix.

This is the **restricted null model** used in [Felix et al 2017](https://doi.org/10.1101/236687), [Pinheiro et al 2019](https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.2796), and [Mello et al 2019](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-019-1002-3). It was derived from the [vaznull model](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0030-1299.2007.15828.x).

The restricted null model is particularly useful for testing for a compound topology, i.e., a modular structure with internally nested modules. Our model allows comparing observed and expected values of nestedness between species of the same module (NODFsm), and between species of different modules (NODFdm). 

Functions to compute NODFsm and NODFdm have already been implemented in the [bipartite package for R](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bipartite/index.html).

This code contains 2 functions to be used sequentually:

## (1) PosteriorProb

Computes pairwise probabilities of interaction among species for a matrix with a modular structure. 

### Arguments

1. M -> a matrix. The original matrix for which posterior probabilities will be calculated.

2. R.partitions -> a vector of integers. It must containd info on row partitions.

3. C.partitions -> a vector of integers. It must containd info on column partitions.

4. Prior.Pij -> method for computing "a priori" probabilities of interaction between species i and j. Can be defined as: 

    a. "equiprobable": probability of interaction identical to all species.  

    b. "degreeprob": probability of interaction proportional to overall species degrees.

    c. "degreeprob.byarea": probability of interaction proportional to species degrees in each matrix area.

5. Conditional.level -> level to which conditional probability of interaction among species i and j will be conditioned. Can be defined as: 

    a. "matrix": conditional probabilities identical in all matrix areas.

    b. "modules": conditional probabilities differing between areas within and outside modules.

    c. "areas": a different conditional probability in each matrix area. 
    
<!-- Precisa explicar o que sÃ£o essas "areas" mencionadas em 5.c --> 


## (2) RestNullModel

Restricted null model derived from the vaznull model. Uses the pairwise probabilities generated by PosteriorProb to draw interactions for the null matrices.

### Arguments

1. M: Matrix -> a matrix. The original matrix to be randomized.

2. Pij.Prob -> a matrix. Matrix of probabilities with the same dimensions of M, computed by PosteriorProb.

3. Numbernulls -> integer. Number of null matrices to be produced.

4. Print.null -> logical. If simulation progress should be printed. Default is FALSE.

5. allow.degeneration -> logical. If null matrices are allowed to degenerate. Default is FALSE.

<!-- Precisa explicar o que significa "degenerate" neste contexto --> 

6. return.nonrm.species -> logical. If the index of non-removed rows and columns should be returned in the output. Default is TRUE.

7. connectance -> logical. If connectance of the null matrices should be either exactly (TRUE) or aproximately (FALSE) the same as the original matrix. Default is TRUE.

8. byarea- > logical. If interactions should be drawn independently for each matrix area. Default is FALSE.

9. R.partitions -> vector of integers. Partition of rows. Used only if byarea = TRUE.

10. C.partitions -> vector of integers. Partition of columns. Used only if byarea = TRUE.
